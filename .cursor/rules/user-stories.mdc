# User Stories Structure
This rule defines how user stories should be structured and formatted in the project.

## File Location
User stories are stored in the `docs/user-stories` directory, with the following structure:
```
docs/user-stories/
├── epic-1/
│   ├── story-1.md
│   └── story-2.md
└── epic-2/
    └── story-3.md
```

## File Naming Convention
- Files should be named using kebab-case
- Format: `{descriptive-name}.md`
- Example: `search-by-tag.md`, `create-new-post.md`

## Story Template
Each user story should follow this template:

```markdown
---
id: US-{number}
title: {Short descriptive title}
status: draft | in-progress | completed
priority: low | medium | high
created: {YYYY-MM-DD}
---

## As a...

## I want to...
{clear, concise description of the feature/functionality}

## So that...
{benefit or value this provides}

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] {criterion 2}
- [ ] {criterion 3}

## Notes
{Optional: Any additional context, technical notes, or considerations}

## Related
