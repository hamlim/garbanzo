## As a...
Project developer

## I want to...
Have a lightweight system for managing and organizing user stories in markdown format

## So that...
I can easily track feature requirements and reference them during development with AI assistance

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User stories are stored in a clear directory structure
- [ ] Stories follow a consistent markdown template
- [ ] Stories can be easily referenced in AI conversations
- [ ] Stories are version controlled with the codebase
- [ ] Stories maintain minimal but sufficient detail for development

## Notes
The structure should remain simple and not impose too much overhead on the development process. Stories should be easy to create, update, and reference.
